Fixes for issue  #20 Remove obsolete wiki pages

Initial content of the Package Maintainer Docs
was imported from various wiki pages.
After Package Maintainer Docs have been published,
replace the old wiki pages with links pointing to the new docs.
There have been some updates to the wiki in between,
so check for them and import them to the Docs also.

So far the first step taken is to extract from adocs the imported page's list.
